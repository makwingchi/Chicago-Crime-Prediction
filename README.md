# Spatial Crime Modeling - the case of Chicago

### Description
In this project, I used geospatial variables collected from [Chicago Open Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) to predict the number of crimes in each 400 meters * 400 meters grid cell in the city of Chicago. The algorithm here is Poisson regression.

### Required Libraries
- `tidyverse`
